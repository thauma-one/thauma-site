 * Tests for workers/src/admin.js
 *   node workers/test/admin.test.mjs
 *
 * Every other endpoint in this Worker is partner-scoped, so a bug leaks one
 * partner's data to somebody who already had a grant to it. NOTHING here is
 * scoped — these queries reach every user, every partner and the whole audit
 * log by design. The role check is the only thing in the way, so it is what
 * these tests are about.
